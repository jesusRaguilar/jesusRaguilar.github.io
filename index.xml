      <description>The datasets ‘education’ and ‘wages’ were chosen for exploratory data analysis. The ‘education’ dataset contains a wide range of aspects for U.S. education (K-12) and finance mainly for the years 1992-2016, with our focus on revenue and expenditure. The ‘wages’ dataset contains minimum wages set by the states and the federal government for the years 1968-2020. After many hours of searching for data in the R datasets, I decided to turn to other sources.</description>

      <description>The dataset “project1data” was derived from project 1 and we will be observing a subset of the original variables, a total of 9 variables and 1,200 observations. The dataset consists of student enrollment, revenue, expenditure, and minimum wage data across the 50 states of the U.S. through the years 1993-2016. There is also a ‘Percent’ variable which refers to the percent of expenditure contributed to instructional expenditure (educational purposes for grades K-12), and a ‘wage_cat’ variable which places the state in a low, intermediate, or high category based on that year’s minimum wage.</description>
