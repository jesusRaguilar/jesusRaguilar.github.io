      <description>Thereâ€™s currently a hot debate in the world of coding today, and that is, which programming language is better, R or Python? Well something that can be agreed upon is that a bilingual person has a greater advantage over a monolingual speaker. So why not learn both programming languages if possible? Knowing both R and Python will give you a great advantage when trying to land a job. People often communicate using two languages and one can do exactly that with R and Python using the reticulate package.</description>
