There's currently a hot debate in the world of coding today, and that is, which programming language is better, R or Python? 

Well something that can be agreed upon is that a bilingual person has a greater advantage over a monolingual speaker. So why not learn both if possible? Knowing both R and Python will give you a great advantage when trying to land a job. People often communicate using two languages and one can do exactly that with R and Python using the reticulate package.
```{r}
library(reticulate)

```

```{python}

```
