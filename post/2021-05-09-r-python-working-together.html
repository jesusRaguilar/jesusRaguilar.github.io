<p>There’s currently a hot debate in the world of coding today, and that is, which programming language is better, R or Python?</p>
<p>Well something that can be agreed upon is that a bilingual person has a greater advantage over a monolingual speaker. So why not learn both programming languages if possible? Knowing both R and Python will give you a great advantage when trying to land a job. People often communicate using two languages and one can do exactly that with R and Python using the reticulate package. Don’t believe me? Take a look!</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(reticulate)
hey &lt;- &quot;lets&quot;
how &lt;- &quot;create&quot; 
are &lt;- &quot;secret&quot;
you &lt;- &quot;code&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="python"><code>the=&quot;so&quot;
reports=&quot;we&quot;
are=&quot;arent&quot;
done=&quot;discovered&quot;
print(r.hey,r.how,r.are,r.you,the,reports,are,done)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## lets create secret code so we arent discovered</code></pre>
<p>As shown above, R and Python can be intertwined together and this is just a basic example. Whether it’s for top secretive agencies or other corporations, there are a multitude of tasks made possible using R and Python simultaneously. Time consuming and tedious it might be, but definitely worth the try!</p>
